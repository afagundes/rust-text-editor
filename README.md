# Rust Terminal Text Editor

This is my (very simple) implementation of a terminal text editor.

The cool thing about it is that I was watching a [Java tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT4JYQi9w4w) 
while coding in Rust.

I believe the code is not so good yet, since it's a project with the objective of training a language I've been 
learning for a week ðŸ˜€. But eventually I'll come back and refactor as I learn new tricks.
